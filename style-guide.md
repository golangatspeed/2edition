# Go Faster Writing Style Guide

## Overall Tone and Voice

**Personal and Humble**: Your writing is refreshingly personal and authentic. You share your own learning journey openly, acknowledging mistakes and confusion as part of the process. This creates trust and relatability.

**Encouraging and Supportive**: You use phrases like "I sincerely hope you enjoy it" and acknowledge that readers may have different backgrounds. The tone is never condescending or assuming.

**Conversational yet Professional**: You write as if speaking directly to the reader, using "you" and "I" naturally, but maintain technical accuracy and professionalism.

## Key Writing Characteristics

### 1. Personal Learning Narrative
- **Pattern**: You often frame concepts through your own discovery process
- **Example**: "When I started learning Go I was productive... but often, I'd find myself in a bind"
- **Maintain**: Continue sharing insights from experience while teaching concepts

### 2. Clear Problem-Solution Structure
- **Pattern**: Identify the confusion/problem, then provide clear explanation
- **Example**: Explaining why "unexported" doesn't mean "private" by addressing common misconceptions
- **Maintain**: Always contextualize WHY something matters before explaining HOW

### 3. Practical, Stripped-Down Examples
- **Philosophy**: "Examples are simple by design... all non-essential code is stripped away"
- **Pattern**: Focus on demonstrating specific principles, not building real applications
- **Maintain**: Keep examples minimal and concept-focused

### 4. Gentle Guidance Style
- **Pattern**: Use phrases like "we should make decisions about..." rather than "you must..."
- **Tone**: Suggestive rather than prescriptive
- **Example**: "it is not recommended practice" instead of "don't do this"

## Technical Writing Patterns

### Code Presentation
- **Numbered examples** with descriptive captions
- **Line-by-line code** with syntax highlighting
- **Playground integration** for hands-on learning
- **Inline code** using italics for technical terms

### Explanation Structure
1. **Context setting**: Why this topic matters
2. **Simple example**: Demonstrate the concept
3. **Detailed explanation**: Break down what's happening
4. **Practical considerations**: When/why to use this approach

### Terminology Approach
- **Italicize** new or important terms on first use
- **Define before using**: Explain terms like "marshalling" when first introduced
- **Use precise language**: "exported" vs "public", explaining the distinction

## Chapter Organization Patterns

### Section Structure
- **Clear hierarchical numbering**: 1.1, 1.2, etc.
- **Descriptive headings**: "Installing and using Godoc" not just "Godoc"
- **Logical progression**: Build concepts incrementally

### Content Flow
1. **Introduction**: What we'll cover and why it matters
2. **Core concept**: Main idea with simple example
3. **Variations/details**: Edge cases, alternatives, best practices
4. **Practical application**: How to use this in real scenarios

## Language and Style Preferences

### Sentence Structure
- **Mix of short and medium sentences**: Avoid overly complex constructions
- **Active voice predominant**: "Go will only marshal..." not "Fields are only marshaled by..."
- **Clear subject-verb-object**: Who does what to what

### Word Choice
- **Accessible but precise**: Technical accuracy without jargon overload
- **British English**: "colour" not "color", "realised" not "realized"
- **Inclusive language**: "developers" rather than "programmers" or "coders"

### Common Phrases to Maintain
- "We call this..."
- "Let's outline..."
- "The example below shows..."
- "In a nutshell..."
- "Before long..."

## Content Philosophy

### Learning Approach
- **Acknowledge different backgrounds**: "knowledge may differ, depending on their route into programming"
- **Focus on understanding over memorization**: Explain the "why" behind patterns
- **Build incrementally**: "laying solid building blocks"

### Technical Approach
- **Opinionated with rationale**: "Go Faster is opinionated with its semantics"
- **Practical over academic**: Focus on what developers actually encounter
- **Context-aware**: Consider coming from OOP backgrounds

## Standards for New Content

### When Adding Go 1.20-1.25 Features
1. **Frame in learning context**: How does this fit the Go philosophy?
2. **Provide simple examples**: Strip away non-essential complexity
3. **Connect to existing knowledge**: How does this build on what readers know?
4. **Include playground links**: Maintain hands-on learning approach
5. **Explain practical value**: When and why would you use this?

### Voice Consistency Checklist
- [ ] Personal but not overly casual
- [ ] Encouraging and supportive tone
- [ ] Clear problem/solution framing
- [ ] Examples that isolate the concept
- [ ] British English spelling and phrasing
- [ ] Humble, learning-focused perspective

## What NOT to Change

- **The personal, authentic voice** - This is what makes the book special
- **The practical, stripped-down examples** - They work perfectly
- **The incremental learning approach** - Matches how people actually learn Go
- **The encouragement and humility** - Creates trust with readers
