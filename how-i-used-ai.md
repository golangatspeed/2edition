# How I used AI

In this age of artificial intelligence, it would be silly not to leverage the power of tools like Claude and Claude Code to assist when writing this second edition. However, I want to be completely transparent about how AI was used in this process - and more importantly, how it wasn't.

Unlike some books flooding the market today, AI was not used to pump and dump a title. It was not used to generate entire chapters wholesale, nor to create content without deep subject matter expertise guiding every decision. Instead, it was used meticulously according to a carefully planned collaborative process that I'll outline below.

## The collaborative process

The approach I followed was systematic and deliberate:

**Initial analysis and planning**
- I uploaded the original book content and established clear project goals
- We analyzed the existing chapter structure and identified where Go 1.20-1.25 features would best fit
- We researched and documented all significant language changes since Go 1.19
- We decided on integration strategies that would enhance rather than disrupt the book's flow

**Style preservation and consistency**
- I provided clear instructions about maintaining my original writing voice and tone
- We analyzed examples from existing chapters to understand the teaching approach
- Every addition was crafted to match the conversational, practical style readers expect
- We ensured new content felt natural within the existing narrative structure

**Chapter-by-chapter collaboration**
- Each chapter was approached individually with specific feature integration goals
- We reviewed original content first, then identified enhancement opportunities
- New sections were written with my guidance on approach, depth, and examples
- All code examples were kept minimal and focused on demonstrating specific concepts

**Quality assurance throughout**
- We maintained detailed progress tracking across multiple markdown files
- Example numbering was carefully managed to ensure consistency
- Each chapter received multiple review passes for technical accuracy and style
- We documented every change made for transparency and future reference

**Integration decisions**
- Some chapters like "Project Organization" were merged to eliminate duplication
- New chapters like "Modern Go Development" were created for cutting-edge features
- Features were placed where they made most pedagogical sense, not just chronologically
- We balanced comprehensiveness with approachability throughout

## What comes next

The AI-assisted phase is now complete, but the real work begins. What follows is:

- **Full editorial review** by me as the author, ensuring every sentence serves the reader
- **Example testing and verification** - every code sample will be run and validated
- **Flow optimization** - reading the entire book to ensure smooth progression
- **Complete renumbering** - systematic check of all chapters, sections, and examples
- **Platform migration** to LeanPub with continued editing and review at every step

## Why I'm telling you this

I'm disclosing this process to show the care taken and respect for my readership. I've purchased books myself where AI involvement was obvious but undisclosed - filled with generic content, factual errors, and examples that clearly hadn't been tested by someone who actually understands the subject matter. That's not what happened here.

Every enhancement in this second edition reflects genuine expertise in Go programming, combined with AI's ability to research, organize, and articulate complex technical concepts. The AI didn't write this book - it helped me write a better version of the book I originally created.

This collaborative approach allowed me to focus on the high-level decisions about content organization, pedagogical flow, and ensuring technical accuracy, while leveraging AI's strengths in research, consistency checking, and detailed implementation. The result is a book that maintains the original's accessible style while comprehensively covering modern Go development practices.

The transparency matters because readers deserve to know how their learning materials are created. This wasn't a quick AI cash grab - it was a thoughtful collaboration between human expertise and artificial intelligence, with the human firmly in control of all technical and editorial decisions.
