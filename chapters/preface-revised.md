# Preface

*When I started learning Go I was productive with the language fairly quickly. After only a short time I could build fast, safe and stable applications which could run anywhere. Before long I was choosing Go in preference to PHP and Node JS - the other languages I'd been developing with - whenever possible.*

*I continued my journey with Go and learned more as I went, but often, I'd find myself in a bind - Golang wouldn't do what I wanted it to. I'd find workarounds sure, but they often seemed clunky. As I tackled more advanced problems this happened more frequently and at times it seemed like I couldn't achieve what I wanted with Go at all!*

*After facing many of these challenges, I realised the actual problem wasn't with Go, but with my knowledge. For one thing, I found I sometimes didn't understand how Go wanted me to solve a problem - in the idiomatic 'Go' way. Other times, I discovered I had missed some of the more nuanced detail about a topic, which on the surface had appeared straightforward.*

*In a nutshell, I had quickly acquired a core of knowledge about Go - enough to write programs - but I had limited understanding of what was happening under the hood when the compiler took my code off me and ran it.*

*So I decided to try cementing my understanding by teaching Go to others via a weekly Blog and on-site training sessions under the [GolangAtSpeed](https://golangatspeed.com) brand. Both aimed to discover and expose what I called "the longtail of Go": the less obvious parts, the quirky idioms and the gotchas, the things that may catch other developers out too.*

*Covid-19 brought a premature end to the on-site training and the blog mostly fizzled out due to me jumping back into contract Go development at a time of uncertainty. But, I promised myself (and some blog readers) that I'd write a book on the same theme and, almost three years later, the first edition was born!*

*Since then, my career has taken me somewhat away from daily Go development, though I return to it whenever I can. When Go 1.25 was released, I realised how much the language had evolved since that first edition, written for Go 1.19. This second edition represents my attempt to continue that learning journey - both for myself and for others who are either just getting started or need to get up to speed with modern Golang too.*

*Working collaboratively with AI assistance - while reviewing and editing every word myself - I embarked on a systematic exploration of what was new. This approach proved remarkably effective for rediscovering Go's evolution and ensuring comprehensive coverage of modern features, from range over functions to Profile-Guided Optimization.*

*Before you jump into the book itself, I want to thank you for purchasing it. I sincerely hope you enjoy it and get much value from it. I also hope you enjoy your journey with Go as much as I have my own, and that this book helps you navigate modern Go development faster!*

*Finally, my learning journey continues, and I'm sharing what I've discovered because I believe it will help others. Whether you're new to Go or catching up with its recent evolution, we're all learning together. If you have any feedback or spot any mistakes, please do reach out - you'll help make this book better for everyone who follows!*

*Best wishes,*
