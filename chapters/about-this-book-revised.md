# About this book

*Go Faster* is a book for those wanting to learn the Golang programming language. Though many great books have been published on this subject with the same aim, this second edition of *Go Faster* takes a slightly different approach, and comes with an interesting backstory.

For starters, it recognises that Go is a relatively simple language with just 25 keywords and that most developers do not struggle to learn its limited syntax.

It acknowledges that most readers will be able to set up a Golang development environment using one of the operating system-specific binaries, without needing detailed instruction.

It recognises that most readers will have a basic level of programming knowledge already - possibly even prior experience with Go - but that that knowledge may differ, depending on their route into programming and the languages they have used to-date.

The examples in *Go Faster* are simple by design. There are no real world or useful applications, instead, all the non-essential code is stripped away to help the user see the principles being demonstrated and grasp the concepts.

*Go Faster* is designed to assist developers coming from object-oriented programming. It elaborates in areas which can confuse since the Go programming paradigm is different than that of OOP. And like Go itself, *Go Faster* is opinionated with its semantics.

Now, here's where this second edition becomes rather interesting. When I wrote the first edition, I was working daily with Go and felt quite current with the language's development. Since then, my employment has moved me somewhat away from the Golang development space, though I return to it whenever I can. When Go 1.25 was released, I realised just how much the language had evolved since the first edition was written for Go 1.19.

This second edition represents as much a learning journey for me as it hopefully will for you. Working with AI assistance - but with every word reviewed and edited by me - I embarked on a systematic review of the first edition. We identified what was new in Go versions 1.20 through 1.25, integrated each new feature thoughtfully, and decided where it best fit within the existing structure, or whether it made sense to add entirely new sections.

This collaborative approach proved remarkably effective. The AI helped identify and research new language features, while I ensured they were presented in a way that maintains the book's original philosophy and tone. Every example was crafted to demonstrate principles clearly, every explanation reviewed to ensure accuracy, and every integration decision made with the reader's learning journey in mind. This process itself, got me back up to speed with modern Golang development!

The book now covers modern Go development comprehensively, from the fundamental concepts that remain unchanged, through to cutting-edge features like range over functions, Profile-Guided Optimization, and the evolution of the standard library through versioned packages. It explores how Go maintains its commitment to backwards compatibility while continuing to evolve and improve.

Finally, *Go Faster* still reflects a learning journey - now both the author's original path and this recent rediscovery of Go's evolution. It remains laid out not as an A-to-Z style reference, but in a way that should enable understanding earlier, laying solid building blocks on which the reader can progress.

If I was learning modern Go from scratch today, this is how I would structure that learning path, and hopefully, it is this structure which helps users at all levels gain a solid understanding of contemporary Go development, quickly.
