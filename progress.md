### üìù Session Notes

**Current Session Goals Met:**
- Project foundation established
- Feature research completed  
- Integration strategy confirmed
- Style analysis completed
- **Chapter 6 revision completed** - Added Go 1.21+ built-in functions
- **Chapter 7 revision completed** - Removed premature generics content, added forward reference
- **Chapter 9.6 revision completed** - Added Go 1.24 generic type aliases as section 9.6.4

**Author Writing Style Identified:**
- Personal, humble, and encouraging tone
- Clear problem-solution structure with learning context
- Practical, stripped-down examples with Go Playground integration
- British English with conversational yet professional voice
- Focus on understanding over memorization

**Key Style Findings:**

- Integrated seamlessly with existing content flow

**Chapter 7 Revision Details:**
- ‚úÖ Added brief "look ahead" mention of generics with forward reference to Chapter 9
- ‚ùå Removed generic type aliases section (moved to saved content for Chapter 9.6)
- ‚ùå Removed math/rand/v2 section (moved to saved content, needs placement decision)
- ‚úÖ Maintained comprehensive coverage of all original data types content
- ‚úÖ Preserved logical learning progression without premature advanced concepts
- **Important**: math/rand/v2 content saved and must be placed somewhere - significant feature

**Chapter Restructuring Completion:**
- ‚úÖ **Chapter 10a "Generics" created** - Dedicated standalone generics chapter
- ‚úÖ **Chapter 9 updated** - Removed section 9.6, updated introduction text  
- ‚úÖ **Content preserved** - All generics content (sections 10a.1-10a.4) including type aliases
